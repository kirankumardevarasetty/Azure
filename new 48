Sure! Here's an example of how you can create a User Assigned Identity (UAI) module in Azure using Terraform.

Create a file named main.tf and add the following code:

terraform
Copy code
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_user_assigned_identity" "uai_example" {
  name                = "uai-example"
  resource_group_name = "your-resource-group-name"
  location            = "your-resource-group-location"
}

output "uai_object_id" {
  value = azurerm_user_assigned_identity.uai_example.principal_id
}
Make sure to replace "uai-example" with your desired name for the User Assigned Identity. Also, update "your-resource-group-name" and "your-resource-group-location" with the appropriate values for your Azure resource group.

Next, initialize the Terraform configuration by running the following command:

shell
Copy code
terraform init
Then, authenticate with Azure by executing:

shell
Copy code
az login
Once authenticated, you can apply the Terraform configuration by running:

shell
Copy code
terraform apply
Review the changes and if everything looks good, confirm by typing yes.

Terraform will then create the User Assigned Identity in Azure. After the execution is complete, you will see the output showing the uai_object_id, which represents the principal ID of the created User Assigned Identity.

Remember to use the appropriate Azure provider version in your main.tf file based on the version of the Terraform Azure provider you have installed.

That's it! You have created a User Assigned Identity module in Azure using Terraform.

Certainly! I'll provide you with an example of how you can structure your Terraform code for creating a User Assigned Identity (UAI) module in Azure.

First, let's create the variables.tf file to define the variables used in the module:

terraform
Copy code
variable "uai_name" {
  description = "Name for the User Assigned Identity"
  type        = string
}

variable "resource_group_name" {
  description = "Name of the resource group"
  type        = string
}

variable "resource_group_location" {
  description = "Location of the resource group"
  type        = string
}
Next, we'll create the data.tf file to fetch existing data from Azure:

terraform
Copy code
data "azurerm_subscription" "current" {}

data "azurerm_resource_group" "existing" {
  name = var.resource_group_name
}
Then, create the locals.tf file to define any local variables used within the module:

terraform
Copy code
locals {
  uai_resource_group_name = data.azurerm_resource_group.existing.name
}
Now, let's create the main.tf file to define the resources:

terraform
Copy code
resource "azurerm_user_assigned_identity" "uai_example" {
  name                = var.uai_name
  resource_group_name = local.uai_resource_group_name
  location            = var.resource_group_location
}

output "uai_object_id" {
  value = azurerm_user_assigned_identity.uai_example.principal_id
}
Finally, create the outputs.tf file to define the outputs of the module:

terraform
Copy code
output "uai_object_id" {
  description = "Principal ID of the created User Assigned Identity"
  value       = azurerm_user_assigned_identity.uai_example.principal_id
}
With this structure, you can easily add or modify variables, data sources, and outputs as needed for your specific use case.

Remember to replace "your-resource-group-name" and "your-resource-group-location" with the appropriate values in the variables.tf file.

To use this module, you can create a separate Terraform configuration file (e.g., main.tf) in a different directory and call the module using the module block, passing in the required variables.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
